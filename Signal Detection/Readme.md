### Custom Modules to Detect Signals
**sigtimeseries.py**
  - This module contains functions specifically designed to detect sudden changes in time-series signals
  - Evaluation of algorithm performances will be determined via Monte-Carlo simulations with noise sampled from:
    + Normal Distribution
    + Uniform Distribution
    + Laplace Distibution
