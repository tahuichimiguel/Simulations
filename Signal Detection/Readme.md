### Custom Modules to Detect Signals
1. **sigtimeseries.py**
  - This module contains functions specifically designed to detect sudden changes in time-series signals
  - Evaluation of statistical based detection algorithm performance determined via Monte-Carlo simulations with noise sampled from 3 statistical distributions: **Normal Distribution**, **Uniform Distribution**, & **Laplace Distibution**.
    
### Monte-Carlo Evaluations
1. **Monte Carlo Assessment of sigtimeseries.delta_outlier.ipynb**
  - Assess the effect of noise distribution and detection threshold on signal detection performance
