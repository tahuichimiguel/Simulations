# Statistical-Simulators

### Bootstrap Simulation (Normal & Approximately Normal Distributions)
- Graphical and quantitative analysis of bootstrap simulations of multivariate functions with inputs sampled from Gaussian, Student, and standard normal Distributions.
- This type of analysis is directly relevant to tolerance analysis used in engineering design with small sample sizes.
