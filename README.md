# Simulators

#### Sampling Simulation (Gaussian, Student, & Standard Normal Distributions)
- Graphical and quantitative analysis of bootstrap simulations of multivariate functions with inputs sampled from Gaussian, Student, and standard normal Distributions.
- This type of analysis is directly relevant to tolerance analysis used in engineering design with small sample sizes.
- **Language** Python

#### Radiative Heating in Absorptive and Scattering Media
- Simulation of radiative heating by plane-parallel slabs at 500K and 1000K.
- **Language:** Java

#### Simulation of Unsteady Heat Generation in a Disposable Battery
-  Simulation of transient conduction heat transfer in a cylindrical body composed of a ï¿¼heterogeneous material subject to both volumetric heat generation and convection heat transfer
- **Language:** Java

# Custom Signal Detection Algorithms 

#### Signal Detection
- Custom module for signal detection of time series data
- **Language:** Python
