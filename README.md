# Simulators

#### Sampling Simulation (Normal & Approximately Normal Distributions)
- Graphical and quantitative analysis of bootstrap simulations of multivariate functions with inputs sampled from Gaussian, Student, and standard normal Distributions.
- This type of analysis is directly relevant to tolerance analysis used in engineering design with small sample sizes.
- **Language** Python

#### Radiative Heating in Absorptive and Scattering Media
- Simulation of radiative heating by plane-parallel slabs at 500K and 1000K.
- **Language:** Java

#### Simulation of Unsteady Heat Generation in a Disposable Battery
- Simulation of transient heating of a battery subject to electric heating and external convection.
- **Language:** Java
